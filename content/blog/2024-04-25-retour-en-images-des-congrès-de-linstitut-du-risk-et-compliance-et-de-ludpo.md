### Why was Cap4 Learning present? We'll explain it all to you!

Corinne Plourde, CEO of Cap4 Learning and a member of UDPO, intervened several times during the congress, notably on the subject of the new CNIL certification for training centers alongside Benoît Pellan, in charge of tool development at CNIL. She also addressed the importance of cookie management in 2021, cybersecurity in service of DPOs, as well as the right to access data versus practical data portability.

These are critical topics for companies that had to adapt and implement new working methods following the difficulties encountered by the Covid-19 pandemic. New working methods that have revealed restrictions on our freedoms and thus impacted our security.

This event also allowed Marie Rohrmann, Marketing and Event Manager, accompanied by Clara Caria and Inès Riva, Marketing and Event Assistants, to welcome and inform people interested in the training provided by Cap4 Learning to face this new era.

### Event Overview: Where and When?

The congress took place at the prestigious Marriott Hotel located on the Champs Elysées in Paris on July 6th and 7th. An iconic location in Paris given its geographical location and its reputation.

The day of July 6th ended with a dinner for all DPO members at the Baccarat Museum named the "Cristal Room Baccarat" and a guided tour of the museum after the meal.

### And Covid in all of this?

This was the first in-person event Cap4 Learning participated in since the Covid-19 crisis. We were delighted to see that many people attended and that health regulations were respected throughout these two days.
